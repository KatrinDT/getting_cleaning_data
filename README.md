# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project

The course project focuses on a data set for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.


This repository contains the following files:
+ README.md: this file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
+ CodeBook.md: a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
+ run_analysis.R: the R script that was used to create the data set (see the Creating the data set section below)
+ tidy_data.txt: contains the final cleaned data set that can be created by using the code run_analysis.R.
